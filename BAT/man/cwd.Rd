\title{Community Weighted Dispersion.}
\usage{
cwd(comm, trait, abund = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{comm}{A sites x species matrix, with incidence or abundance data about the species in the community.}

\item{trait}{A species x traits matrix, with trait values for each species in comm.}

\item{abund}{A boolean (T/F) indicating whether abundance data should be used (TRUE) or converted to incidence (FALSE) before analysis. If not specified, default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A sites x trait matrix with sd value per site and trait.
}
\description{
Standard deviation value of each of a series of traits in multiple communities.
}
\details{
Community weighted dispersion is used to compare communities in terms of their dispersion of trait values around a mean, reflecting individual trait variability or diversity.

comm <- matrix(c(2,5,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,10,1), nrow = 4, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)
rownames(comm) = c("Site1","Site2","Site3","Site4")
