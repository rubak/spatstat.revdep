\title{Plots an object obtained with \code{RelativeProbabilityNetwork}}
\usage{
PlotRelativeProbabilities(X, rel_probs, rotation_angle = 0,
  eps_image = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{- A \code{lpp} object representing a marked point pattern lying on a road network (\code{linnet} object)}

\item{rel_probs}{- An object containing the relative probabilities of a specific type of event along the linear network contained in \code{X}, generated through the function \code{RelativeProbabilityNetwork}}

\item{rotation_angle}{- A rotation angle (in degrees, from 0 to 180) to apply to the network (to improve visualization, if required). By default it is set to 0}

\item{eps_image}{- If set to \code{TRUE}, an .eps image is generated. By default it is set to \code{FALSE}}
}
\description{
This function plots the relative probability of occurrence of a type of event along a linear network
