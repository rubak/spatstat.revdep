Description: A collection of functions and data - mostly from Texas - is provided. 
  These are used as teaching tools for geo-spatial data analytics courses in the 
  GISciences program at The University of Texas at Dallas. In addition, several 
  vignettes illustrate geo-spatial data analytics practices, such as relative 
  risk kernel density estimations based on food store locations within Dallas 
  County or the identification of homogenous and spatially contiguous market areas 
  built on socio-economic, demographic and infrastructure census information. The 
  spatial resolution of the data-sets ranges from 1623 food store locations, over 
  geo-referenced areal data of 258 Texan counties, to 529 census tracts as well 
  as 1669 block groups in Dallas County. Cartographic, specialized regression and 
  data handling functions are provided.
